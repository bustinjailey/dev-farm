# Simple Caddy Configuration for Dev Farm with Path-Based Routing
# Replace the old farm.bustinjailey.org sections with just this:

farm.bustinjailey.org {
    import lan_reverse_proxy_http 192.168.1.126:5000
}

# That's it! All routing is now handled by nginx inside the LXC.
# 
# The nginx proxy will:
# - Serve dashboard at /
# - Route /env/{env-name} to the appropriate environment container
# - Handle WebSocket and SSE connections
# - Show friendly error pages when environments aren't ready
#
# No need for port-specific rules anymore!
