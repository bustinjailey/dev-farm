# Environment Modes Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

Based on your TODO requirements, I've successfully implemented all requested features:

### 1. ‚úÖ Three Environment Modes

**üíª Workspace Mode (Default)**

- Empty folder for new projects
- Perfect for experimentation and starting from scratch
- No additional setup required

**üì¶ Git Repository Mode**

- Clone repositories from GitHub
- Built-in repository browser that lists your GitHub repos
- Paste any Git URL manually if preferred
- Repository is cloned automatically on container startup
- Ready to edit, commit, and push immediately

**üîå Remote SSH Mode**

- Connect to remote servers via SSH
- Remote-SSH extension automatically installed
- SSH config automatically created with provided credentials
- Workspace includes setup instructions
- Perfect for editing files on remote systems

### 2. ‚úÖ Mode Selection UI

**Dashboard Enhancements**:

- Dropdown selector to choose mode when creating environment
- Conditional form fields that appear based on selected mode
- Git mode shows:
  - URL input field
  - "üìö Browse" button to load your GitHub repositories
  - Repository list with descriptions
  - Click to select from your repos
- SSH mode shows:
  - SSH Host field (IP or hostname)
  - SSH User field (default: root)
  - Remote Path field (default: /home)
  - Instructions about SSH key requirements

**Environment Cards**:

- Display mode icon and details on each environment
- Git mode shows truncated repository URL
- SSH mode shows remote host
- Workspace mode shows as "Workspace"

### 3. ‚úÖ Workspace Trust Settings

**All trust prompts disabled**:

```json
{
  "security.workspace.trust.enabled": false,
  "security.workspace.trust.startupPrompt": "never",
  "security.workspace.trust.emptyWindow": false
}
```

Every environment now opens in **trusted mode** automatically. You will never see the "Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?" prompt.

## üéØ How To Use

### Creating Environments

**Via Dashboard** (http://192.168.1.126:5000):

1. Click "‚ûï Create New Environment"
2. Enter environment name
3. Select development mode:
   - **Workspace**: Just click Create
   - **Git**: Enter URL or click "üìö Browse" to select from your repos
   - **SSH**: Enter host, user, and path details
4. Click "Create"
5. Environment opens with proper mode configuration

**Via API**:

```bash
# Workspace mode
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.126:5000/create \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"my-workspace","mode":"workspace"}'

# Git mode
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.126:5000/create \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"my-repo","mode":"git","git_url":"https://github.com/user/repo.git"}'

# SSH mode
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.126:5000/create \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"remote","mode":"ssh","ssh_host":"192.168.1.100","ssh_user":"root"}'
```

### Mode Behaviors

**Git Mode**:

1. Container starts
2. GitHub authentication configured
3. Repository cloned to /home/coder/workspace
4. Code-server opens workspace
5. Ready to edit, commit, push

**SSH Mode**:

1. Container starts
2. Remote-SSH extension installed
3. SSH config created at ~/.ssh/config
4. REMOTE_SSH_SETUP.md created with instructions
5. Use Command Palette ‚Üí "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host"

**Workspace Mode**:

1. Container starts
2. GitHub authentication configured
3. Empty workspace ready
4. Create files, initialize git, etc.

## üì¶ What's Stored

Each environment's configuration is saved in `/data/environments.json`:

```json
{
  "my-git-env": {
    "container_id": "abc123",
    "port": 8100,
    "created": "2025-10-27T12:00:00",
    "project": "web-app",
    "mode": "git",
    "git_url": "https://github.com/user/repo.git"
  },
  "my-ssh-env": {
    "container_id": "def456",
    "port": 8101,
    "created": "2025-10-27T12:05:00",
    "project": "server",
    "mode": "ssh",
    "ssh_host": "192.168.1.100"
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Deployment

To deploy these changes to your LXC container:

```bash
# From local machine
cd /home/justin/dev-farm
ssh root@eagle.bustinjailey.org "pct exec 200 -- bash -c 'cd /opt && ./scripts/upgrade.sh'"
```

This will:

1. Pull latest code from GitHub
2. Rebuild dashboard image (picks up new Python dependencies)
3. Rebuild code-server image (picks up new settings.json and startup.sh)
4. Restart dashboard container
5. New environments will use the new features

**Note**: Existing environments won't be affected. They'll keep working with their original configuration. Only **newly created** environments will have the mode features.
