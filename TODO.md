Allow me to initiate the github auth workflow from the dashboard and use that created session within all of my newly-created environments

When the IDE starts, make Copilot front and center. I want this to be mobile-friendly/first so make IDE elements bigger and put Copilot chat in the main/center window. Copilot will be the main way I interact with the IDE on mobile.
