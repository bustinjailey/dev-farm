TODO

I want each dev environment to operate in one of two modes

1. Remote mode, where it uses the Remote - SSH extension to open a remote folder as the workspace, in which changes can be made and tested
2. Git repo mode, where it creates a repo from a Git URL or list from the signed-in user. This becomes the workspace where changes can bemade and tested.

For both modes, the user should select what they want before creating an environment, and the environment should open in the proper mode.
